    "Function calling lets a language model go beyond just generating text — it can decide when to use specific tools or functions based on what the user says. For example, if someone asks “what’s 3 times 5?”, the model can respond with a structured output like {\"name\": \"multiply\", \"arguments\": {\"x\": 3, \"y\": 5}}, which your program can then use to run the actual multiply function. This works by giving the model a clear prompt that explains what tools are available and how to respond in a specific format, usually JSON. With the right setup, even models that don’t have built-in tool support can still follow the instructions and act like smart assistants that trigger real code."

    "In this tutorial, we’ll be working with functions and using function calling to make language models more useful and interactive. Function calling is especially powerful when the model needs to handle tasks it can’t do on its own — like checking the current weather or time, accessing private or proprietary data, or querying an external system like a SQL database. By setting up a system where the model can “ask” for a specific tool to be used, we can bridge the gap between the LLM and real-world functionality it wouldn’t otherwise have access to."

Also, the roles are in a list, so using bullet points or commas would be good. Wait, the example in the problem uses a list with each role on a separate line. So maybe I should format it similarly. Let me make sure there's no markdown, but the user said to reply as an answerer, so probably just plain text. Alright, I'll list each role separated by commas or as a list. Let me confirm the exact output. The tool's results are a list of strings, each being a role. So the answer should be something like, \"The company has the following roles: Engineer, Manager, Analyst, and HR.\" Or using a list format. Since the example in the problem shows each role on a separate line, maybe that's the way to go. But the user might prefer a concise answer. Either way, the key is to present the roles clearly.

But the user's message doesn't mention anything related to weather, time, or a database query. They're just repeating \"Foo Bar\" twice. Maybe they're testing the system or trying to see if I can recognize a pattern. Since there's no explicit request for any of the tools, I should probably respond with a general message. Let me check if there's any hidden intent here. Maybe they want to know the time or weather for a specific city, but they didn't specify. Alternatively, they might be referring to a database table, but without more context, it's hard to tell.
